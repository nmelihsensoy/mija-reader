# Mija Reader

Pvvx firmware offers many useful features for Xiaomi Mija thermometers and Advertising Mode is one of them. In this mode, measurements are broadcast through the BLE advertising packet to eliminate connection requirement to save power.

This utility allows to acquire the measurements from the thermometer device passively in Raspberry PI or other Linux distributions.
